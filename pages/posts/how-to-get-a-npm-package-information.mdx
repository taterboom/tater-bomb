We can certainly look up information about a package by visiting the [npm official website](https://www.npmjs.com/),
but this approach has some drawbacks.

- You need to open a tab in the browser to look up the package
- You need to click on the "Dependency" navigation bar to view the Dependency
- Dependency only shows package name, no other information
- No Github star number
- ...

It is easier to check the information of a package by aggregating Dependency and github information in an API-like way,

## Npm registry api

[Npm official api](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md) support [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

For example, Fetching `next` package information with the URL https://registry.npmjs.org/next/latest, and this is the simple result

```json
{
  "name": "next",
  "version": "12.2.5",
  "description": "The React Framework",
  "repository": { "type": "git", "url": "git+https://github.com/vercel/next.js.git" },
  "homepage": "https://nextjs.org",
  "dependencies": { "@next/env": "12.2.5", "@swc/helpers": "0.4.3" }
}
```

We can get the version, repository address, dependencies and other information from this simple result.

## Github api

You can fetch github information through its official api.

- [restful](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api)
- [graphql](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)

Github api doesnâ€™t support [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), and there is a rate limit. Restful only has 60 requests per hour without the github authorization. Graphql must be logged in to use.

## Fetch Github Document

Getting information by fetching Github document like a web crawler.

This method does not support [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

For example:

First, get the git repository document for nextjs by the url `https://github.com/vercel/next.js.`

Second, parse out document result via [DOMParser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser)(in browse) or [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom)(in nodejs), and then get data from dom element . For example, the text content of the `#repo-stars-counter-star` element is the stars count of the repository.

## PDJ

PDJ is a tool that aggregates information about an npm package, it extracts the information and displays only the basic information about a package:.

- Introduction
- npm weekly downloads
- github star count
- Denpendency list, including the description of each dependent package

PDJ has a [Web App](https://pdj.taterboom.com/) and also a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdj/edgpjjbejcjkgnlnehoballnhokglenj). The Chrome extension supports checking the package.json on a github page to display the above mentioned information.
